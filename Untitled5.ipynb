            "The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh Scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). Each of these colors has a different **wavelength** – red has the longest wavelength, and violet/blue have the shortest.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is composed of tiny molecules, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Scattering of Light:** When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it interacts with these tiny molecules. This interaction causes the light to be scattered in all directions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Rayleigh Scattering Explained:**\n",
            "    *   Because the atmospheric molecules are so small compared to the wavelengths of light, they scatter shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) much more efficiently and intensely than longer wavelengths (like red and yellow).\n",
            "    *   In fact, blue light is scattered about 10 times more effectively than red light!\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Why We See Blue:**\n",
            "    *   As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, a significant amount of the blue and violet light is scattered in all directions.\n",
            "    *   This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky, making the sky appear blue.\n",
            "    *   The other colors (green, yellow, orange, red) are not scattered as much and tend to pass more directly through the atmosphere, allowing us to see the sun itself as yellowish-white.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Why not Violet?**\n",
            "You might wonder why the sky isn't violet, since violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue and is scattered even more. There are a couple of reasons:\n",
            "*   **Sun's Emission:** The sun actually emits slightly less violet light than blue light.\n",
            "*   **Human Eye Sensitivity:** Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light. So, even though there's violet light being scattered, we perceive the overall mix of blue, violet, and some green as blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "**What about Sunsets and Sunrises?**\n",
            "This same scattering phenomenon also explains why sunsets and sunrises are red, orange, or yellow. When the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to travel through a much thicker layer of atmosphere to reach your eyes. By the time it reaches you, most of the blue and violet light has been scattered away, leaving primarily the longer-wavelength red and orange light to pass directly through to your eyes.\n"
